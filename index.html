        <span class="quote-gold">"Nine years. It still feels unreal when I say it out loud. We started as two imperfect people trying to understand each other, and along the way we fought, we cried, we laughed, and we grew. It was never a fairytale every single day—but it was always real. Every argument taught us patience. Every misunderstanding taught us communication. And every hard moment made our love stronger. We didn’t just stay together; we built something together. From silly conversations and late-night talks to serious decisions about our future, we slowly shaped a life side by side. We watched each other grow, supported each other’s dreams, and stood together during the toughest times. That’s what makes these nine years so special—not perfection, but commitment. Today, we’re not just in love. We’re engaged. And soon, in this very year, we’ll begin a new chapter as husband and wife. Thinking about that fills my heart with gratitude. Thank you for choosing me every day, even when it wasn’t easy. Thank you for being my safe place, my partner, and my best friend.
Nine years down, a lifetime to go.

            <p>Not just the kind people applaud—but the quiet kind.
Building a home where peace lives, where effort is respected, where dreams are taken seriously.
Whatever I become, whatever we achieve—your belief will always be part of the story.</p>

They’ll talk about how we loved.
With honesty. With loyalty. With intention.
That’s the legacy I want—us.</p>

Even the messy pages. Especially those.</p>

            If life ever gets hard, remember this:
You are not alone. You never were.
I’m here—for your fears, your victories, your silence, your laughter.

Thank you for growing with me instead of away from me.
Thank you for loving me in ways I didn’t know I needed.

Today marks 9 years of love.
Soon, it marks forever.

And if I had to choose again—
in every lifetime, in every version of this world—
I’d still choose you.

Always. ❤️
