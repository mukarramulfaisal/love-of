        <span class="quote-gold">"Nine years. It still feels unreal when I say it out loud. We started as two imperfect people trying to understand each other, and along the way we fought, we cried, we laughed, and we grew. It was never a fairytale every single day—but it was always real. Every argument taught us patience. Every misunderstanding taught us communication. And every hard moment made our love stronger. We didn’t just stay together; we built something together. From silly conversations and late-night talks to serious decisions about our future, we slowly shaped a life side by side. We watched each other grow, supported each other’s dreams, and stood together during the toughest times. That’s what makes these nine years so special—not perfection, but commitment. Today, we’re not just in love. We’re engaged. And soon, in this very year, we’ll begin a new chapter as husband and wife. Thinking about that fills my heart with gratitude. Thank you for choosing me every day, even when it wasn’t easy. Thank you for being my safe place, my partner, and my best friend.
Nine years down, a lifetime to go.

    <div class="wish-grid">
        <div class="wish-item">
            <h3>Success</h3>
            <p>“Success,” I hope it tells the story of two people who never gave up on each other. Success for us will not just be money, a house, or achievements. It will be the peace in our home, the respect in our words, and the love we protect every day. It will mean we faced problems together, supported each other’s dreams, and kept choosing each other no matter what. If we grow, stay kind, and build a happy family side by side, then our love itself will be our greatest success.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wish-item">
            <h3>Strength</h3>
            <p>“Strength,” I hope it reflects everything we have survived and built together. Strength for us is not about never fighting; it’s about never giving up. It’s about holding hands during hard times, staying patient when emotions are high, and choosing understanding over ego. Our strength is in our loyalty, our trust, and the way we protect each other’s hearts. It’s growing together, forgiving quickly, and standing side by side against every challenge. If we continue to support, respect, and believe in one another, then our love will always remain our greatest strength.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wish-item">
            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>“Legacy,” I hope it reflects the life and love we built together. Legacy for us is not just about wealth or success, but about the values we live by every day—respect, honesty, patience, and faith. It is the memories we create, the family we raise, and the kindness we show to others. Our legacy will be the way we stand by each other through every season of life and the example we set for those who look up to us. If our love leaves behind warmth, strength, and good character, then that will be our true legacy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wish-item">
            <h3>Adventure</h3>
            <p>“Adventure,” I hope it begins with a beautiful journey together—first to perform Umrah, side by side, with grateful hearts. I imagine us standing in Makkah, praying together, asking for blessings for our marriage and our future. That will be the most meaningful trip of our lives.

After that, I see us traveling the world, exploring new places, tasting different foods, learning new cultures, and collecting memories instead of things. Our adventure will not just be about destinations, but about sharing every moment together. As long as we are hand in hand, every journey will feel special.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #ccc;">
            I just want you to know something from my heart.

No matter what the future brings, I promise to always choose you. Not only on the easy days, not only when we’re happy—but especially on the hard days. I know we’re not perfect, and we will still have misunderstandings sometimes, but I promise to listen more, to be patient, and to protect your heart the way it deserves.

I don’t just want to love you; I want to understand you, support your dreams, and grow with you. I want to build a home where you always feel safe, respected, and valued. If I ever make mistakes, I’ll try to fix them, not ignore them. Our relationship is too important to me to take for granted.

You are not just my partner. You are my peace, my motivation, and my future. Let’s keep building something so strong that no problem can break it. Together, always.
