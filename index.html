        <span class="quote-gold">"Nine years ago, we didn’t know what life would throw at us.
We didn’t know how strong we’d need to be, how patient, how forgiving.
But somehow, we chose each other—again and again.
And today, that choice feels more powerful than ever.

You didn’t just love me.
You stood by me.
Through confusion, growth, dreams that scared us, and versions of ourselves we were still becoming.
If love had a face, it would look like the way you stayed."</span>

            <h3>Success</h3>
            <p>Not just the kind people applaud—but the quiet kind.
Building a home where peace lives, where effort is respected, where dreams are taken seriously.
Whatever I become, whatever we achieve—your belief will always be part of the story.</p>

            <h3>Strength</h3>
            <p>You are my calm when life gets loud.
My reminder that softness is not weakness, and love is not fragile.
With you, I’ve learned that real strength is staying gentle even when the world isn’t.</p>

            <p>One day, people won’t just talk about what we did.
They’ll talk about how we loved.
With honesty. With loyalty. With intention.
That’s the legacy I want—us.</p>

            <h3>Adventure</h3>
            <p>From late-night talks to lifelong plans,
from simple moments to big leaps—
I want every chapter with you.
Even the messy pages. Especially those.</p>

            If life ever gets hard, remember this:
You are not alone. You never were.
I’m here—for your fears, your victories, your silence, your laughter.

Thank you for growing with me instead of away from me.
Thank you for loving me in ways I didn’t know I needed.

Today marks 9 years of love.
Soon, it marks forever.

And if I had to choose again—
in every lifetime, in every version of this world—
I’d still choose you.

Always. ❤️
